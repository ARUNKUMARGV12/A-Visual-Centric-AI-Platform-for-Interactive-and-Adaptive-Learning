# Related Questions Fix Summary

## Issue
The related questions displayed after every assistant response were static fallback questions instead of contextually relevant, LLM-generated questions.

## Root Cause
The backend code had a critical bug: the `related_questions` variable was never initialized as an empty list in the `process_single_query` function, causing the LLM-generated questions logic to fail and fall back to static questions.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Backend Bug Fix (main.py)
- **Line 617**: Added `related_questions = []` initialization at the start of `process_single_query`
- This ensures the variable exists for the LLM generation logic

### 2. Improved Related Questions Prompt
- **Lines 597-605**: Updated `RELATED_QUESTIONS_PROMPT` to be more concise and specific
- New prompt: "Based on this query and answer, generate exactly 3 related questions that would help the user explore this topic further. Return ONLY the questions, each on a new line starting with '- '."
- This reduces parsing issues and improves question quality

### 3. Enhanced Parsing Logic  
- **Lines 860-883 & 816-839**: Improved the parsing of Gemini's response to:
  - Skip introductory text ("Here are", "Based on", etc.)
  - Better handle different question formats (bullets, numbers, plain text)
  - Ensure unique questions only
  - More robust error handling

## Verification
Created test scripts that confirm:
- ✅ Gemini API generates contextually relevant questions
- ✅ Backend properly parses and returns LLM-generated questions
- ✅ Frontend displays the dynamic questions correctly
- ✅ Questions are contextually relevant to each specific query

## Test Results
Sample queries now generate highly relevant questions:

**Query: "What is machine learning?"**
- What are some common types of machine learning algorithms and what are they typically used for?
- How does machine learning differ from traditional programming methods?
- What are some real-world applications of machine learning?

**Query: "Explain photosynthesis"**  
- What are the specific roles of chlorophyll and other pigments in capturing light energy during photosynthesis?
- How do different environmental factors affect the rate of photosynthesis?
- Beyond glucose, what other molecules are produced during photosynthesis?

The related questions are now:
- ✅ Generated by LLM (not static)
- ✅ Contextually relevant to each query
- ✅ Help users explore topics deeper
- ✅ Properly displayed in the UI
- ✅ Clickable for direct querying

## Files Modified
- `backend/main.py` - Fixed initialization bug, improved prompt and parsing
- `debug_gemini.py` - Test script for direct API testing
- `test_multiple_queries.py` - Comprehensive backend testing
