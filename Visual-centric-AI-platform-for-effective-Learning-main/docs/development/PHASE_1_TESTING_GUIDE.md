### 3. **Learning Analytics Testing**
**Purpose**: Verify activity tracking and insights generation

#### Steps:
1. **Generate Activity Data**:
   - Visit different pages (5+ times each)
   - Play knowledge games (complete 2-3 quizzes)
   - Use voice assistant (ask 3+ questions)
   - Use visualizer feature

2. **Check Learning Insights**:
   - Go to "Learning Insights" dashboard
